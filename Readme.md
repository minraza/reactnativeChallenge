# ReactNative challenge 
Thank you very much for investing your time in the recruitment process of ToolTime. We hope that you will find this one an interesting way to spend a couple of hours on.  

## Help needed!
We started to build the TT mail application and we got stuck. We need your help on couple of topics. The app does not yet need to fetch anything from the server so don't worry about it. We are interested in getting the UI to behave the way we want. 
Please restructure the app and show us a way to provide the following features:

### Features
1. List of emails needs to scroll when users drag their finger on the screen.
2. When user swipes the item to the left, the item needs to be dragged to the left and eventually disappear from the screen. 
3. When user taps on an item, the item needs to fold and unfold and show the contents of the mail. 

## Good to know
You can use any frameworks you want. 
You can use any libraries you want.
Commit all changes to a Git repository and follow good commit message practice.
Focus on good application structure, not a hacky solution.

It's not about the goal but about the journey, show us what you have got!
